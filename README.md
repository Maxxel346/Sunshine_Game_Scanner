# Sunshine GameSync

`sunshine_gamesync.py` is a Python script that automatically scans your game library, generates a valid **apps.json** file, and keeps it updated for [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine).  

This is useful if you have multiple games organized into folders (each with a `Game.exe` inside) and want them to appear automatically in the Sunshine web UI and Moonlight.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure Example

Your game directory should look like this:

Games/
â”œâ”€ Wafer Renyah/
â”‚ â””â”€ Renyah.exe
â”œâ”€ Doom Eternal/
â”‚ â””â”€ Game.exe
â””â”€ Hollow Knight/
â””â”€ Game.exe

Each subfolder = one game.  
The script will map:
- **name** â†’ folder name  
- **cmd** â†’ full path to `.exe`  
- **working-dir** â†’ the game folder

## âš¡ Features
- Scans all subfolders for `Game.exe`.
- Generates/updates a proper `apps.json` file.
- Removes deleted games automatically.
- Runs as a lightweight watcher (near 0% CPU).
- JSON format matches Sunshineâ€™s expected schema.
